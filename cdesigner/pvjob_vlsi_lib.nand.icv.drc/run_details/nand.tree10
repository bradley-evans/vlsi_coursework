Exploded placements       The total number of exploded placements in the
			   design.
Total Data count          The total number of all polygons, paths, 
			  edges, and rectangles in the design.
Sref Placements           The total number of cell references in the design.
Arefs                     The total number of array references in the design.
Aref Placements           The total number of references in each array
			  reference in the design.
Data                      The number of data primitives in each cell
