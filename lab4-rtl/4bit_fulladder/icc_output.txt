Legalizing 8 illegal cells...
Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
        The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 30 sites
        and the median cell width is 13 sites. This makes it difficult for
        the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
        displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of
        legalization to see the impact of the fragmentation.
